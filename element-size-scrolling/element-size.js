// ELEMENT SIZE AND SCROLLING
// There are many js properties that allow us to read information about element width, height, and other geometry features.
//we often need them when moving or positioning elements in js
/**
 * // Sample Element
 * // as a sample element to demonstrate properties we'll use the one given below:
 * <div id="example">
  ...Text...
</div>
<style>
  #example {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 25px solid #E8C48F;
    padding: 20px;
    overflow: auto;
  }
</style>

// Window sizes and scrolling
// Theoretically, as the root document element is document.documentElement, and it encloses all the content, we could measure the documentâ€™s full size as document.documentElement.scrollWidth/scrollHeight.
